# LSP ideas/proposals

## Graphics

* No textures
* All round items (tanks, capsules, etc.) should have the same number
  of sides, preferably a multiple of both 4 and 6 (4 for things like
  RCS, and 6 for stacking the most tanks possible); the lowest number
  that satisfies both is 12. (This is so that graphically, radially
  attached objects are always attached to a flat surface.)

## Physics

* Treeform proposed using a single convex hull for the entire ship.
* Problem: there is no such thing as breaking then. If you wanted to,
  you could build an entire ship that rested on a single RCS nozzle.
